    (I don't think this is doable in Javascript, except by using hard-coded
    header. However, converting UTF-8 to other character set is going to be 
    a headache.)
    
; Input charset ("UTF-8")

; Output charset ("UTF-8")

  : Defines the expected input document character set, as well as the output. By
    default, UTF-8, because it's the de-facto standard for the web. (Don't think
    this is doable for Javascript.)
