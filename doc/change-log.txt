BareBonesMarkup Change Log
==========================



v2.0.0 - v1.0.0
---------------

=== Javascript Runtime Requirement ===

ECMAScript 5 compatible web browser or standalone Javascript engines:

- Internet Explorer 9+ 
- Opera 12+
- Safari 5+
- Firefox 4+
- Google Chrome 13+
- Konquerer 4.9+
- node.js (Google V8 Javascript Engine)
- Rhino
- PhantomJS



=== Code Blocks & Inline Code Characters ===

The backtick (grave accent) character "\`" shall replace the ASCII 
double-quote in the syntax for Inline Code and Code Block. 



=== Inline Code Relaxation ===

In addition to the Inline Code Character Change, The Inline Code syntax 
now starts with one or more backtick characters, down from three or more. 
Specifically:

```
`Code` ``Code `Nested Code` Code``
```



=== Text Formatting: Inserts and Deletes ===

Text insertion markup `{++ Arbitrary Text ++}` is removed from the grammar.
Text deletion markup has been changed from `{-- Deleted Text --}` into 
just two consecutive dashes: `-- Deleted Text --`.



=== Pre-formatted Text Output ===

Pre-formatted Text Output no longer generates a `<code>` wrapper inside 
the `<pre>` tag in HTML output.



=== ATX-Header Inline Formatting ===

Texts in ATX header can now be formatted with inline elements. That is, 
it's now possible to include hyperlinks, images and bold text in ATX 
headers, so long as they do not contain line breaks or closing ATX tokens.

```
= **Bold H1 Header** =
```



=== Default Alt Text in Images ===

Alt text in image elements shall be left blank, but not undefined by default, 
unless an alt text is explicitly provided using the link continuation syntax.

```
!<http://www.imageHoster.com/something.jpg>

<img src="http://www.imageHoster.com/something.jpg" alt="">
```

```
!<Image.jpg>-[Alt text]

<img src="Image.jpg" alt="Alt text">
```



=== Reference Link Elements ===

Reference Links `:{ID}: URL` no longer generates a node in the parse tree, 
and thus no longer qualified as an implicit list breaker.

Reference Links scoping have been removed to reduce implementation complexity. 
That is, block-level elements no longer has scopes with link identifiers. 
Last-defined valid link identifier wins. 

```
> :{ID}: URL-One

  I'm a paragraph using ?<ID>-[URL-Zero].

:{ID}: URL-Zero
```

In this particular example, the second definition of `ID` shall be used to 
create `<a href="URL-Zero">URL-Zero</a>.



=== Line Break Requirements ===

Setext Paragraph delimiters, Horizontal Rules, Fenced Code Blocks, Comment 
Blocks, and Div Block delimiters must be immediately followed by a line 
break.

They will not count as valid delimiting token otherwise. Specifically:

```
- ```    
  This is not a pre-formatted block, but rather an inline code snippet, 
  because there are invisible white space after the starting fence.
  ```
```


=== Hyperlink Display Text ===

Square bracket balancing has been removed. If internal link URL or link 
display text contains a closing square bracket, that bracket must be 
escaped with a backslash.

```
?<http://www.somewebsite.com>-[[1\\]]
```



=== Text Formatting: Error Recovery ===

If a hyperlink, image, or formatting construct fails to close properly, 
the recommended recovery behavior is to interpret the rest content under 
that context until it is closed.


```
**Strong but not closed

**''Badly Nested** Not Italic.

?<Unclosed URL -[Rest of my document]

**?<URL>-[Rest of my document** Not part of the link display text.
```


=== BlockStop ===

The syntax "BlockStop" has been removed. This functionality can be replaced 
by the Comment syntax, which now occupy a spot in the abstract syntax tree.

```
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

////
////

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
```
