Introduction
============

BakaBakaMark (BBM) is an experimental Text-to-HTML lightweight document markup 
language for the less technically inclined web writers. The primary focus is 
on substance, semantics, and ultimately the intention of the writing. As such, 
the language is meant to be read and written easily in plain text **by other 
human beings**, with a reasonably functional text editor ''alone''.

As a language, BBM aims to save your brain, your eyes and your fingers from 
verbose markup languages. It saves your fingers, because you don't have to 
type out all the noisy markup. It saves your eyes from looking at walls of
punctuation symbols, like the source code of a Wikipedia page. Finally, it 
saves your brain because the syntax (should) closely resembles the way you 
write your Email, comments, or prose in general.

As a personal tool, BBM is a compiler that converts markup text into (X)HTML. 
The tool is meant to be a quick way to generate standalone documents with 
guaranteed structural markup validity. (Without involving an external HTML 
sanitizer) Lastly, the main syntax itself is highly extensible, with just 
enough basic features to satisfy most of your writing needs.

As a software project, the syntax is officially documented. It has a fully 
functional, well-defined grammar, with detailed behavioral descriptions on 
ambiguous and error cases. Being easy to read and write alone is not enough; 
In fact, consistent & acceptable behaviors across different platforms is also 
very important, so is the ease of implementation. Otherwise, if one likes BBM 
and BBM is unfortunately a pain to port in a consistent manner, it would have 
been a very regrettable ordeal.



Philosophy & Goals
==================

Prose, semantics, and structure; These elements are the basis of almost all 
publications. BBM is completely devoted to make writing prose and specifying 
these details as painless as possible and leaves no room for ambiguity. For 
other issues, BBM stays out of the way and let the experts deal with them.

Regarding its syntax, it's the plain text syntax **I** prefer to use.

> Squares and rectangles are beautiful. White spaces are clean on the eyes. 
  Line by line instructions are clear, concise, and unambiguous. These 
  philosophies are the basis of BakaBakaMark syntax.

Hopefully writing BakaBakaMark consists of three easy steps:

1. Write a block of content.
2. Format the content with ASCII symbols and plain-text message conventions.
3. Indent. (If needed at all)

And hopefully, porting BakaBakaMark is also easy as these steps:

1. Read a short grammar definition.
2. Read a short semantic rules summary & glance over sample implementation.
3. Write a hand-written compiler in your favorite programming language for 
   BakaBakaMark, targeting whatever markup language suiting your taste buds.
   
BakaBakaMark isn't a programming language, but I still want it to be the ideal
described in article ?<IPLR>-[Irreducible Programming Language Requirements].
