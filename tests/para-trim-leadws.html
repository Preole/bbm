This is 
preferred. 
Everything is lining up 
against the left-margin.

This is acceptable, if one wants to ensure spaces are visible within the
 same paragraph, if manual line breaks are not to be interpreted as white
 spaces. Some typesetting tools and markup languages, such as HTML, treat
 line breaks as white space for automatic word-wrapping by default.
</p>
<p>
This treatment is okay for English and most languages from the
 Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, but that line break conversion is going to
 cause problems in other alphabets.
</p>
<p>
Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) don't have space
 characters in their alphabet. If writers were to write in such a language,
 and they want to manually line-wrap their text, they're going to see
 unwanted space in their text because of the conversion from line break
 to space.
</p>
<p>
BakaBakaMark can be configured eliminate that conversion for writers who
 prefer to manually line-wrap in such languages. If one enables that
 configuration and one wishes to deliberately preserve the space in a 
 visible manner, one can write in this style.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, one can put the space at the end of every line. This 
results in invisible syntax, which can be difficult to track down if 
line breaks are not interpreted as spaces.

<p>
This is bad. Insufficient

indentation level terminates the ongoing paragraph and 
starts a new one.
