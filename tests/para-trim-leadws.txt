  This is 
  preferred. 
  Everything is lining up 
  against the left-margin.
  
  This is acceptable, if one wants to ensure spaces are visible within the
   same paragraph, if manual line breaks are not to be interpreted as white
   spaces. Some typesetting tools and markup languages, such as HTML, treat
   line breaks as white space for automatic word-wrapping by default.
   
  This treatment is okay for English and most languages from the
   Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, but that line break conversion is going to
   cause problems in other alphabets.
   
  Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) don't have space
   characters in their alphabet. If writers were to write in such a language,
   and they want to manually line-wrap their text, they're going to see
   unwanted space in their text because of the conversion from line break
   to space.
   
  BakaBakaMark can be configured eliminate that conversion for writers who
   prefer to manually line-wrap in such languages. If one enables that
   configuration and one wishes to deliberately preserve the space in a 
   visible manner, one can write in this style.
   
  Alternatively, one can put the space at the end of every line. This 
  results in invisible syntax, which can be difficult to track down if 
  line breaks are not interpreted as spaces.
   
  This is bad. Insufficient 
 indentation level terminates the ongoing paragraph and 
 starts a new one.
