////
If excessive inline formatting nesting abuse is encountered, only the first 
N opening constructs are recognized. The rest of the opening tokens should be 
treated as TEXT. 

Arbitrary nesting are allowed, though the only tags that have such use 
cases are nested insertion, deletion, superscript and subscript. The former 
two are best handled by revision controls or explicit "UPDATE:" statement. 
The latter two use cases should be delegated to a professional tool for 
typesetting Mathematics, such as LaTeX.
