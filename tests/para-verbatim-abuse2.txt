////
Due to the parser backtracking every time it fails parsing a section 
of verbatim text, **the performance suffers dramatically**. This behavior 
is necessary if the latter part of the paragraph needs to render the 
text-formatting. 

At around ~2000 opening link symbols, it takes the parser ~2s to complete 
on a Windows 7 64-bit machine with 2GB free RAM, ~2.0ghz CPU, using 
Chrome 33. As a result, it's perfectly acceptable to treat the rest of the 
document as plain text, if a verbatim section, such as a URL or a code 
snippet fails to close.

In this particular example, no text is actually underlined, even though 
there are matching underlining tags within the wall of text.
