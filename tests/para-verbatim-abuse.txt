resulting in N^^2^^ run time, and also generates 
an unnecessary amount of garbage due to backtracking.

A strictly correct implementation may render """^^2^^""" as superscript. 
However, the preceding code snippet syntax will induce a lot of unnecessary 
backtracking and degrade performance. It's acceptable to parse the rest of 
the document literally, if a verbatim text context fails to close properly 
before the end of the paragraph.
