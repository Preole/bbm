"""\"\"\""""

A backslash character always turns the next character into a literal text 
character, except space and newlines. The backslash character is always 
discarded regardless of context.

Note: The escape entity "&quot;" can be replaced with the typewriter's 
double quote in normal HTML context, such as inside a <p> tag. If the 
build target is XHTML, then it needs to be escaped.
