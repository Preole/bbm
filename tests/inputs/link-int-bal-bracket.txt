#[#[Section][Bracket]]-[Go to #[#[]] Section Bracket]


////
The Internal Link starting token """#[""", as well as the literal opening 
square brackets """[""", are both effective in terms of determining bracket 
balancing in contexts where bracket balancing matters. In such contexts, 
they do not need to be backslash escaped so long as they're balanced.
