<strong>This option is primarily for East-Asian languages to prevent erraneous
white-space, as East-Asian text usually don't treat line breaks as white

    <p>
CSS-Internal ("")
    </p>
    <p>

parameter here is a file path. File names are separated by (Some delimiter 
character).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
CSS-External ("")
    </p>

    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
(I don't think this is doable in Javascript, except by using hard-coded
header. However, converting UTF-8 to other character set is going to be 
a headache.)
  </p>
 </dd>
 <dt>
Input charset ("UTF-8")
 </dt>
 <dt>
Output charset ("UTF-8")
 </dt>
 <dd>
  <p>
Defines the expected input document character set, as well as the output. By
default, UTF-8, because it's the de-facto standard for the web. (Don't think
this is doable for Javascript.)
  </p>
 </dd>
 <dt>
CSS-Class-Prefix ("XXX")
 </dt>
 <dd>
  <p>
Defines the CSS prefix for the class attribute, which acts as the hook for
CSS selectors.
  </p>
 </dd>
 <dt>
CSS-ID-Prefix ("XXX")
 </dt>
 <dd>
  <p>
As above, except this is for the ID attribute, which are used for internal
links within the same document. This should be a sufficiently random
integer that wouldn't collide with an existing ID in the same document.
  </p>
  <p>
(Suggestion: At least 8 digits. Cryptographically strong random numbers
are not necessary. If invoked from a web browser, the browser should
first check if the generated ID prefix already exists.)
  </p>
 </dd>
 <dt>
"javascript:" Directive (Off)
 </dt>
 <dd>
  <p>
Allow "javascript:" directive inside hyperlink and image element. If
disabled, the "javascript:" directive will be subtituted with something
harmless.

 </dd>
 <dt>
"data:" Directive (Off)
 </dt>
 <dd>
  <p>
As above, except this one is for Data URI.
